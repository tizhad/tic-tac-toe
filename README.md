# Challenges

This game was my first experience with developing a game, handle frontend for more than one client, first experience with Ember.js, Rails and Ruby.

Some of my challenges:
- First shot with SQLite.
- My best buddy for the game's frontend was : https://guides.emberjs.com/v4.9.0/tutorial/part-1/
  I started with creating an application in Ember.js. That was one of the easiest part and I got there soon.
- Then I tried to know about Ruby on Rails, what is rails at all and how can I have it in my game.
  I couldn'y make a good relation with rubyonrails guids, so this make it a little bit hard ro find solution for the problems.
  Most challenging part was finding a way to having a real-time connection for the game, after checking the github repos, watching videos on youtube and reading a lot of articles, I figure it out that there are some various ways to do that, after considering my time and my knowledge in Ember.js and RailsI I've decided to use short pulling.
  If I had more time I prefer to change it and use another solution.
- Creating database and models and migration was the easy part because I worked with database before and I knew that what I need, the only thing that I needed to do it was to know how can I do it in Rails.
- Another challenge was showing UI (buttons, form and ... ) in Ember.js. I didn't know how can I show specific item based on a condition! so needed some search. The problem with this part of development was various versions of Ember.js.
  So tried to consider my game's ember version.

## Improvement
- Create more components to separate codes based on the functionality.
- Use ActionCable for having a real-time connection.
- Better error Handling.
- Reload page handling to redirect user to the in-progress game.
- Disable UI after click and change the round.
